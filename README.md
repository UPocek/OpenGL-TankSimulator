# Tank Simulator Game from Scratch - OpenGL Graphics

## Idea
Goal for this project was to create small, but functional game from scratch in c/c++ programming language using the OpenGL graphics library. 

OpenGL is "The Industry Standard for High Performance Graphics", as they say on their webiste, but in all sioursnes it is pretty cool API that enables us to code our own rendering logic and game engine from scratch so üëç for that.

I choose tank simulator for two reasons. Firstly this topic enabled me to try out all different things OpenGL can offer, including textures, shaders, uniforms and user controlls and second is that I wanted to have this game when I was a kid, you can't blame me for that. What is more rewarding then beeing able to use your new learning and skills to make your past self proud. So with everything in place I jumped into the code.

## Game
If you want to play my game just clone this repo and double clik on .sln file to open it in your editor (I have used VisualStudio 2022 for development prrposes) then just run the source code and full screen tank simulation will pop up ready to kick some sirous ass. 

Commands are pretty streight forward, use arrow keys `‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí ‚Üê` for
