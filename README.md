# Tank Simulator Game from Scratch - OpenGL Graphics

## Idea
Goal for this project was to create small, but functional game from scratch in c/c++ programming language using the OpenGL graphics library. 

OpenGL is "The Industry Standard for High Performance Graphics", as they say on their webiste, but in all sioursnes it is pretty cool API that enables us to code our own rendering logic and game engine from scratch so üëç for that.

I choose M-84 tank simulator for two reasons. Firstly this topic enabled me to try out all different things OpenGL can offer, including textures, shaders, uniforms and user controlls and second is that I wanted to have this game when I was a kid, you can't blame me for that. What is more rewarding then beeing able to use your new learning and skills to make your past self proud. So with everything in place I jumped into the code.

## Game
If you want to play my game just clone this repo and double clik on .sln file to open it in your editor (I have used VisualStudio 2022 for development prrposes) then just run the source code and full screen tank simulation will pop up ready to kick some sirous ass. 

Commands are pretty streight forward, use arrow keys `‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí ‚Üê` for moving the M-84 cockpit and amming for targets when you are on target press `Space` key for firing is you were accurate target will disapere from the screen and indicator light from top left coorner of the screen will torn off for 7.5 seconds indicationf CoolDown period, after witch you will be able to fire again. If tank's cupola is moving to slowly for your likings try pomping in more power to it by pressing the `p` and `o` keys to increese and decress voltage in motors respectivly. If have just 6 ammos so use then wisely. Clicking the `c` key will transer your view inside the cookpit where you will be able yo see tank statistics and plan your next move, clicking the `v` key will bring back sight and amming view. Practice your shooting and write your best time to hit all 3 targets.
